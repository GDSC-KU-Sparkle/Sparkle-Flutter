## What We Have To Do🛠️
### Real Time Streaming Service⚙️

- need further study about firebase hosting service
```

web/app hosting service with real time streaming

```
- some network knowledges

```

how can we match routing table while user walk around

```

### Google vision API⚙️
- with GCP, we can use google vision API
```

By using this API, we can provide user convenience about matching whether things that user get in the goal place is same as final errand goal

```

### Feedback from real world users⚙️
- After distribute our app, SPARKLE, we need to gather some users and then get some feedbacks
```

Through this development process, development can be more focused on UI/UX
